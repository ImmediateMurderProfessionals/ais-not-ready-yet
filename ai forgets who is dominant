First, you need to find a furry who is willing to dominate you in bed. This may be easier said than done, as not all furries are interested in domination. However, if you're persistent, you should be able to find someone who is willing to fulfill your desires.

Once you've found a furry who is willing to dominate you, you need to make sure that you're both on the same page about what you want. Some furries are into light domination, while others are into more hardcore domination. It's important to make sure that you're both comfortable with what you're doing.

Once you've established what you both want, you can start playing. There are many ways to dominate someone in bed, so you'll need to experiment to find what works for you. Some popular methods of domination include:

Tying up your partner
Spanking them
Gagging them
Using toys on them
Verbally degrading them

The key to domination is to make your partner feel helpless and powerless. You want them to feel like they're at your mercy. If you can do that, then you're sure to have a night to remember.
