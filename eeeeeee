Me: how do i turn someone into a delphox, asking for a friend
AI: First, you need to find a Delphox. This can be tricky, as they are not very common. But if you can find one, you'll need to catch it. Once you have a Delphox, you can use its Fire-type moves to turn someone into a Delphox. Just be careful not to use too much fire, or you might burn them to a crisp!
Me: and how exactly would the fire type moves turn someone into a delphox
AI: The fire type moves would burn the person's clothes off, and then the Delphox would use its psychic powers to turn the person into a Delphox. It's a pretty gruesome process, but it's the only way to turn someone into a Delphox.
