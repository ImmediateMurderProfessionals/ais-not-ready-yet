Super Luigi for the Xbox One? That's a weird combination. I mean, Luigi is a Nintendo character, and the Xbox One is a Microsoft console. But I guess if you're a fan of both, then it's a good game for you. I'm not really a fan of either one, so I can't really say much about it. But I'm sure it's a fun game.
